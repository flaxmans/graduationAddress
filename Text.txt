Fearlessness

Greetings graduates, families, friends, and university colleagues.  Thank you all for being here, and congratulations on all that you have achieved individually and as a community.  

Graduates, as you prepare to leave the University of Colorado Boulder, I want to encourage you to reflect on what you are taking with you when you leave.  I don’t mean what stuff you’re taking with you, of course.  I mean, what do you know now that you didn’t know when you first arrived at CU?  Do you approach problems differently now than you used to?  How do you see yourself as a learner?  What can you DO now that you couldn’t do at the beginning of your first year? 

I’d like to provide a frame for how you answer those questions by way of a personal anecdote.

I’ve only ever given one graduation address before, and it was so long ago that most of you were still in diapers.   The audience was much smaller, the demographic was different, and the culture was much different than the culture of this wonderful University and city.  In short, I have very little prior direct experience with the job I’m doing today.  In spite of that, when Dr. Bowers approached me and asked me to give this address, I gladly and immediately said yes.   I felt honored, but also trepidatious.  I also felt some other GRE words that I can’t remember right now.  But I didn’t feel afraid.  The intellectual challenge of writing and delivering an address to all of you was not something that caused me fear.  

Thom Cech, one of this campus’s nobel laureates, said that one of the goals of a graduate program he had helped to architect was to produce graduates who are intellectually fearless.  That doesn’t mean arrogant or full of hubris.  Rather, it means that you aren’t afraid to keep on learning.  You aren’t afraid to try something new and fail the first time you try it, because you know that learning will come out of that experience.  It means you are confident that you can apply what you already know how to do to a new situation, even one outside your own academic discipline.  And it means that you are capable of approaching unfamiliar areas, recognizing they have tools and knowledge applicable to your own problems, and that you are willing to invest your own time and intellectual capital in learning and applying them.

Intellectual fearlessness.

… It isnt’ because they were trained to do these particular things as undergraduates or graduate students
